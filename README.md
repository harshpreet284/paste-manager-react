## 🚀 Project Overview

**SnippetVault** is a modern, client-side web application for managing reusable text snippets. It solves a simple but persistent problem — developers and professionals constantly reuse the same blocks of text (code snippets, templates, commands, notes) and need a fast, organized way to store and retrieve them.

Built with **React 18**, **Redux Toolkit**, and **Tailwind CSS**, the app provides full CRUD operations on text pastes with real-time search, clipboard copy, and browser-based persistence via `localStorage`. No backend, no accounts, no setup — just open and start saving.

**Key highlights:**
- Full create, edit, delete, view, search, and copy workflow
- All data persists locally across browser sessions
- Centralized state management with Redux Toolkit
- Clean, responsive UI with macOS-inspired editor aesthetics
- Deployed on Vercel with SPA routing support

## 🔄 How It Works

1. Open the app → land on the **Home** page with the paste editor
2. Enter a **title** and **content**, then click **"Create My Paste"**
3. The paste is saved to **Redux** and synced to **localStorage**
4. Navigate to the **Paste** page to view all saved snippets
5. **Search** pastes by title using the search bar
6. Use action buttons to **edit** ✏️, **delete** 🗑️, **view** 👁️, or **copy** 📋 any paste
7. Editing redirects back to Home with pre-filled fields and an **"Update Paste"** button
8. Viewing opens the paste in a **new tab** as a read-only page
9. All changes persist across browser sessions automatically
